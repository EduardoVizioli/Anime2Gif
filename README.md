# Anime2Gif
  Anime2Gif is an algorithm that detects scenes in a video and generates gifs from it.
  <br>
# Configuration
  First, you'll need to install the dependencies. In order to install the dependencies, assuming you already have python3 installed, you can run the following commands:<br>
  -pip install opencv-python<br>
  -pip install Pillow<br>
  -pip install numpy<br>
  <br>
  After all the dependecies are installed, you will need to create a directory called "videos" alongside the "main.py" file, and store the videos it will use to generate the gifs.<br>
  <br>
# Running
  To run the program, you can simply call the main.py file with the following command:<br>
  -python main.py<br>
  <br>
  When the program finishes running, you should have a new gif file inside the "temp" folder.<br>
